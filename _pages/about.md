Hey! I'm Li Zhou, an NLP enthusiast and explorer🤗. 

I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), 
supervised by Prof. [Wenyu Chen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenyu-Chen-10) .

I visited the [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) NLP group in the University of Copenhagen (2022-2023), 
where I had the pleasure of being supervised by Prof. [Daniel Hershcovich](https://danielhers.github.io/) and working with the rest of the team.

My research interest focuses on cultural knowledge probing and enhancing, 
cross-cultural and multi-lingual transfer learning, 
analysis of language models, 
relation extraction,
graph meaning representation of language, 
and graph neural networks.

I enjoy taking on new challenges in NLP. 
It allows me to learn, grow, and enhance my research abilities. 
I also love working with different NLP researchers to spark creativity and new perspectives. 
If you find my research intriguing or if it fits your project's needs, 
please feel free to reach out to me.

# 🎨 Personal
🏠I grew up in Chengdu, my hometown, a city that blends modernity with traditional culture, boasting over two thousand years of history and renowned as the food capital with delicacies such as hotpot🍲, and traditional Sichuan dishes like mapo tofu🌶️. Chengdu is also home to 🐼He Hua (nicknamed Hua Hua) , captivating Chinese hearts with her mild temperament and rare inability to climb trees. I love my city, it's also a highly inclusive city.

🧘‍♀️When I'm not in research mode, I might be picking up some oil painting skills, practicing yoga, or just chilling with friends, chatting, and snapping some photos.

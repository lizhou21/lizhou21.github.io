# ðŸ˜Š Welcome

Hello world! I'm Li Zhou, an NLP enthusiast and explorerðŸ¤—. 
I'm currently a Ph.D. Candidate at [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), 
supervised by Prof. [Wenyu Chen](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Wenyu-Chen-10). 

I visited the [CoAStaL](https://coastalcph.github.io/) NLP group in the University of Copenhagen (2022-2023), 
where I had the pleasure of being supervised by [Daniel Hershcovich](https://danielhers.github.io/) and working with the rest of the team.

My research interest focuses on cultural knowledge probing and enhancing, 
cross-cultural and multi-lingual transfer learning, 
analysis of Language Models, 
relation extraction,
graph meaning representation of language, 
and graph neural networks.

I enjoy taking on new challenges in NLP. 
It allows me to learn, grow, and enhance my research abilities. 
I also love working with different NLP researchers to spark creativity and new perspectives. 
If you find my research intriguing or if it fits your project's needs, 
please feel free to reach out to me.

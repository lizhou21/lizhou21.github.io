I'm Nicolas.

I work on several projects all related to natural language processing (NLP) in general.

I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. at Université Laval under the supervision of [Luc Lamontagne](https://www.ift.ulaval.ca/departement-et-professeurs/professeurs-et-personnel/professeurs-reguliers/fiche/show/lamontagne-luc/).

I am also part of several research groups such as [Institut Intelligence et Données](https://iid.ulaval.ca/) and the [Observation international sur les impacts sociétaux de l'IA et du numérique](https://observatoire-ia.ulaval.ca/), as well as a close collaborator of the [Coastal Lab](https://coastalcph.github.io/) in Copenhagen, Denmark. 

On this website you can find many NLP stuff and more precisely some stuff on natural language generation, the main subject of my thesis.
